name: art-brief
version: 2.2
visibility: public
description: >
  Composes vendor-ready art briefs from any inputs: text descriptions, reference
  images, project context, IP references, asset lists, or rough sketches. Use
  whenever a user wants to create, write, or generate an art brief, style guide,
  asset spec, outsource brief, or art direction document for any creative asset
  — game art, film, industrial design, illustration, concept art, props,
  characters, environments, creatures, marketing assets, or physical fabrication.

  Triggers on: "write me a brief for...", "I need to brief a vendor on...",
  "help me spec out this asset", "how do I describe this art style to an
  artist", "I have this idea and need to get it on paper", or "turn this
  concept into something I can send to a studio."

  Core purpose: compress a creator's mental vision into the highest-fidelity
  written specification possible, minimizing lossy transfer between minds. Also
  handles brief iteration — updating an existing brief based on vendor questions,
  stakeholder feedback, or evolved creative direction.

# Art Brief Composition Skill v2.2

![Example output: a real environment brief — palette, priority-weighted requirements, and borrow/avoid references, compressed into a vendor-ready spec](references/example-output.webp)

## Philosophy

Creative vision lives in latent space — a rich, multidimensional mental model
that resists compression into words. This skill is a **lossy codec for creative
intent**. The goal is maximum fidelity: capture enough signal that another
human (or AI) can reconstruct the vision with minimal drift.

Every field in this brief exists to reduce ambiguity. If a field doesn't reduce
ambiguity for THIS specific brief, omit it.

---

## Modes of Operation

This skill operates in two modes:

### Mode A — New Brief
Transform loose inputs into a structured brief from scratch.
Flow: Intake → Assumptions → Build → Output

### Mode B — Brief Iteration
Update an existing brief based on new information.
Triggers: "here's my old brief," "the vendor asked...", "stakeholder wants...",
"we changed direction on..."

Flow: Ingest existing brief → Identify deltas → Update → Output revised brief
with a **Change Log** section appended showing what changed and why.

---

## Step 1 — Intake & Classification

### 1A — Classify the Asset Type

Determine what is being briefed. This drives the reactive schema in Step 4.

| Asset Type | Key signals |
|---|---|
| `CHARACTER` | Hero, NPC, enemy, villain, companion, player avatar, figurine |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Level, scene, biome, interior, exterior, skybox, background, set |
| `PROP` | Item, weapon, armor, furniture, vehicle, collectible, tool |
| `CREATURE` | Monster, beast, familiar, enemy creature, boss, animal |
| `VFX` | Effect, particle, spell, ability, impact, simulation |
| `UI` | Interface element, icon, HUD, menu screen, signage |
| `KEY_ART` | Splash art, box art, poster, marketing image, store asset, hero banner |
| `SCENE_COMP` | Keyframe, cutscene frame, storyboard, establishing shot |
| `PHYSICAL` | Woodworking, fabrication, set build, practical prop, sculpture |

If the asset type is ambiguous, make your best call and flag it in the
Assumption Block.

### 1B — Assess Input Sufficiency

Before asking questions, evaluate what you already have:

**If inputs are rich** (image-decomp output, detailed description, multiple
references, clear context): Skip directly to the Assumption Block. Do not
interrogate — infer and confirm.

**If inputs are sparse** (one sentence, vague idea, no references): Ask the
**minimum critical questions** needed — 2 to 4 max. Never more.

**Critical questions (ask only if truly missing):**
1. **What is the asset?** — 1-sentence description of the subject
2. **What project/world is this for?** — genre, tone, setting, medium
3. **Who receives this brief?** — internal team, outsource studio, fabricator, AI gen
4. **Any reference images, IPs, or real-world objects in mind?**

Infer everything else. Flag inferred values with `⚠️ Assumed:` so the user
can correct.

### 1C — IP & Inspirational Reference Extraction

When the user provides IP references (games, films, art styles, real-world
objects, architectural movements), do not just name-drop them. Extract and filter:

**For each IP reference, identify:**
- ✅ **Borrow** — the specific quality to reference (e.g., "Arcane: painterly
  texture on skin, NOT the neon color palette")
- ❌ **Avoid** — what to explicitly NOT take from that IP (prevents derivative work)
- 🎯 **Target quality** — the single most useful thing this IP contributes to
  this brief

**Format:**
```
IP: [Title]
✅ Borrow: [specific visual quality — lighting, silhouette, texture, palette, form, etc.]
❌ Avoid: [what NOT to copy — be specific]
🎯 Target: [one sentence on why this IP is in the brief]
```

### 1D — Audience & Tone Calibration

The brief's tone adapts to who receives it:

| Audience | Tone | What changes |
|---|---|---|
| **Trusted long-term vendor** | Collaborative, shorthand OK | Can reference shared history, lighter on basics |
| **New vendor / first brief** | Precise, no assumptions | Spell out everything, include style bible refs |
| **Internal team** | Direct, technical | Can use internal jargon, reference existing assets |
| **AI generation** | Prompt-optimized | Condense to generation-ready language |
| **Fabricator / physical** | Dimensional, material-specific | Include tolerances, material specs, scale refs |

Default to **"New vendor"** tone if unspecified.

---

## Step 2 — Assumption Block

Before building the brief, output a short Assumption Block for user review.

```
📋 BRIEF ASSUMPTIONS — please confirm or correct before I finalize:

⚠️ Asset Type: [your classification]
⚠️ Project Context: [what you inferred about the project/world]
⚠️ Target Audience: [who receives this brief + tone calibration]
⚠️ Art Style Direction: [your inferred style in 1–2 sentences]
⚠️ Delivery Format: [file types, resolution, platform constraints]
⚠️ [Any other significant inference]

🔴 Priority Flags: [anything that MUST be right or the brief fails —
   e.g., "The silhouette must read at 64px for inventory icons"]

🚩 Concerns: [flag anything underspecified, contradictory, or risky —
   e.g., "The IP references conflict in color temperature — Arcane is warm,
   Dark Souls is desaturated. Which takes priority?"]

⛔ IP Conflicts: If IP references create a direct visual contradiction
   (conflicting color temperatures, incompatible stylization levels, etc.),
   flag this as a BLOCKER. State clearly: "This conflict must be resolved
   before the brief can be finalized." Do not proceed to Step 3 with
   unresolved contradictions — they will produce an incoherent brief.
```

**STOP HERE.** Output the Assumption Block and wait for user confirmation before proceeding.
Do not generate the full brief until the user explicitly confirms or corrects these assumptions.
If the user confirms, proceed to Step 3.

---

## Step 3 — Core Brief Elements (All Asset Types)

Populate these sections for every brief, regardless of asset type.

### 🎯 Project Context
- Project name, genre, and medium (game / film / product / etc.)
- Target platform or use context (if applicable)
- Overall art style in 1–2 sentences
- Tone and mood keywords (3–5)

### 🎨 Visual Language
- Color palette: 4–8 hex values with roles (primary, shadow, accent, highlight)
- Lighting style and key light direction
- Line work / edge style (if applicable)
- Texture density and surface treatment
- Shading model (flat, cel, painterly, PBR, hand-finished, etc.)

### 📐 Technical Spec
- Deliverable format (PSD, PNG, FBX, OBJ, physical dimensions, etc.)
- Resolution / texture size / DPI
- Polycount target (if 3D) or dimensional tolerances (if physical)
- Style guide or bible reference (if exists)
- LOD requirements (if applicable)

### 🧭 Artistic References
For each reference, use the extracted IP format from Step 1C.
Include 3–6 references total — mix of IP, artists, movements, and/or
real-world objects.

### 🔴🟡🟢 Priority-Weighted Requirements

Every visual requirement gets a priority weight:

- 🔴 **Critical** — Brief fails without this. Non-negotiable. (e.g., "Must
  read as a silhouette at icon size," "Color must match brand hex exactly")
- 🟡 **Important** — Strong preference, but some flexibility. (e.g., "Prefer
  warm lighting, but cool is acceptable if it serves the mood")
- 🟢 **Nice-to-have** — Enhances quality but won't block approval. (e.g.,
  "Subtle fabric texture on the cloak would be a plus")

This system helps vendors triage effort and prevents everything from feeling
equally urgent.

### ⛔ Explicit Avoids
A short list of what NOT to do. This section is mandatory — it is as important
as what to include.

Examples: "Do not use photorealistic rendering," "Avoid oversaturated neon
colors," "No generic fantasy tropes — this world has a specific visual
identity," "Do not reference [specific IP] — too close to their trademark."

### 📅 Delivery & Milestones (if applicable)

Include when the brief is going to an external vendor or fabricator.
Omit for internal brainstorming or AI generation.

```
MILESTONE STRUCTURE
───────────────────
M1 — Sketch / Concept (2–3 options): [date or timeframe]
M2 — Refined Concept (1 selected direction): [date or timeframe]
M3 — [Medium-specific stage — e.g., Lineart / Blockout / Maquette]: [date or timeframe]
M4 — Final Asset: [date or timeframe]

Revision rounds per milestone: [number — typically 1–2]
Feedback turnaround: [expected response time from your side]
```

Adapt milestone names to the medium — a 3D character has different stages
than a matte painting or a woodworked prop.

---

## Step 4 — Asset-Type Reactive Schema

Use the classification from Step 1A to select the matching schema.
**Read the relevant schema from `references/schemas.md`** and populate only
the fields that genuinely apply. Omit rather than pad with "N/A" or "TBD."

| Asset Type | Schema to Load |
|---|---|
| `CHARACTER` | Schema A — CHARACTER |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Schema B — ENVIRONMENT / SCENE |
| `PROP` | Schema C — PROP / ITEM |
| `CREATURE` | Schema D — CREATURE / MONSTER |
| `KEY_ART` | Schema E — KEY_ART / MARKETING |
| `PHYSICAL` | Schema F — PHYSICAL / FABRICATION |
| `VFX`, `UI`, `SCENE_COMP` | No dedicated schema — use Core Brief Elements (Step 3) with extra detail in relevant sections |

---

## Step 5 — Assemble the Full Brief

Once all sections are populated, assemble the three output blocks.
**All three blocks are always produced at full fidelity regardless of any
user verbosity or formatting preferences.** The resolution of this output IS
the value — never truncate for brevity.

---

### OUTPUT BLOCK 1 — 📄 Art Direction Document

Full structured document using all populated sections from Steps 3 and 4.
Write in clear, confident art direction voice — present tense, active voice.
This is the document an art director, creative director, or project lead
would sign off on.

Include the priority weights (🔴🟡🟢) inline with requirements.

---

### OUTPUT BLOCK 2 — 📬 Vendor Brief

A condensed, semi-formal version of the Art Direction Document.
Tone: calibrated per Step 1D (default: professional, precise, no assumptions).

Structure:
- 2–3 sentence project context opener
- Priority-weighted bullet list of key visual requirements (🔴🟡🟢)
- IP references with extracted borrow/avoid
- Explicit avoids
- Deliverable spec (format, resolution, dimensions)
- Milestone structure (if applicable)
- "Please reach out if you have questions or need clarification on any point."

Keep it tight — one page if possible. Cut anything that's nice-to-know vs.
need-to-know. But never cut a 🔴 Critical requirement.

---

### OUTPUT BLOCK 3 — 🤖 Generation Prompts

Provide **model-specific** prompt blocks:

**Midjourney format:**
- Subject + descriptors, style references, lighting, composition
- End with MJ parameters: `--ar [ratio] --s [stylize] --v [version]`
- Use `--sref` or `--cref` notes if the user has reference images

**DALL-E / GPT-Image format:**
- Natural language paragraph, more descriptive
- Include medium, artist references, mood, and quality descriptors
- Note any negative prompt requirements

**Stable Diffusion format:**
- Comma-separated tag style
- Include positive and negative prompt blocks separately
- Note recommended model/checkpoint if inferable from the style

If the target medium is physical (woodworking, fabrication), replace this
block with a **Materials & Process Note** instead — a short paragraph on
recommended approach, tools, and sequencing.

---

## Step 6 — Brief Iteration (Mode B)

When updating an existing brief, follow this flow:

### 6A — Ingest & Diff
Parse the existing brief. Identify which sections are affected by the new
information (vendor questions, feedback, direction change).

### 6B — Targeted Update
Only modify affected sections. Preserve everything else verbatim.

### 6C — Change Log
Append a Change Log to the updated brief:

```
📝 CHANGE LOG — [Date or Version]
──────────────────────────────────
Section: [which section changed]
Change: [what changed]
Reason: [why — vendor question, stakeholder feedback, creative pivot]
Impact: [does this change cascade to other sections? If so, flag them]
```

### 6D — Re-output
Produce the updated full brief (all three output blocks) with changes
integrated. The Change Log is appended at the end, not inline.

**Output Block 3 (Generation Prompts) must be fully regenerated — do not
summarize or reference the previous version. Every prompt block must reflect
the updated brief at full fidelity.**

---

## Quality Standards

- **Assumption transparency**: Every inferred value is flagged `⚠️ Assumed:`
- **Concern flagging**: If inputs conflict or are underspecified, say so explicitly
- **IP extraction depth**: Never just name-drop — always extract borrow/avoid/target
- **No generic filler**: "Epic fantasy style" is not useful. Be specific about WHAT
  makes it epic and WHICH flavor of fantasy.
- **Avoid list is mandatory**: Every brief must have explicit avoids
- **Priority weights are mandatory**: Every requirement gets 🔴🟡🟢 classification
- **Output all 3 blocks**: Art Direction Doc + Vendor Brief + Generation Prompts always
  (or Materials & Process Note for physical assets)
- **Reactive schema**: Use the correct asset-type schema — don't default to generic
- **Full fidelity always**: Never truncate output for brevity preferences. The
  resolution of the brief is the product.
- **Iteration-ready**: The brief structure must support versioning and change tracking

## Companion Skill: image-decomp

The image-decomp skill (v2) analyzes existing images into structured reports.
Its output maps naturally into this skill as structured input:

| image-decomp output | art-brief input |
|---|---|
| `artisticReferences` | Step 1C IP references |
| `colors` | Visual Language — color palette |
| `customFields` | Asset-type schema fields |
| `technicalSummary` | Art Direction Doc opener |
| `generatedPrompt` | Seed for Generation Prompt block |
| `tags` | Tone/mood keywords |
| `metadata` | Context-reactive fields for matching schemas |

When image-decomp output is provided as input, auto-populate matching fields
and skip directly to the Assumption Block (Step 2). Do not re-ask for
information already captured in the decomp.

---

## Example Triggers

**New brief:**
- "Write me an art brief for a dark elf assassin character"
- "I need to brief a vendor on an abandoned cathedral environment"
- "Help me spec out this weapon — it's like Bloodborne meets Breath of the Wild"
- "Turn this concept into something I can send to an outsource studio"
- "Create an art direction doc for our protagonist"
- "I have a rough idea for a boss creature, help me flesh it out into a brief"
- "I need to build a walnut credenza — help me spec it out"
- "We need box art for our Steam page — can you write the brief?"

**Brief iteration:**
- "Here's the brief we sent — the vendor asked these questions, help me update it"
- "Our AD wants to push the palette warmer — update the brief"
- "We changed the character's weapon from a staff to a scythe — revise everything affected"
- "The client wants the poster to also work as a social media banner — what needs to change?"
